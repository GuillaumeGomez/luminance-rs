# Changelog

This document is the changelog of [luminance-webgl](https://crates.io/crates/luminance-webgl).
You should consult it when upgrading to a new version, as it contains precious information on
breaking changes, minor additions and patch notes.

**If you’re experiencing weird type errors when upgrading to a new version**, it might be due to
how `cargo` resolves dependencies. `cargo update` is not enough, because all luminance crate use
[SemVer ranges](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html) to stay
compatible with as many crates as possible. In that case, you want `cargo update --aggressive`.

# 0.5

> Nov 26, 2021

- Fix buffer kind not correctly being used (i.e. mixing vertex and index buffers is not possible, for instance). This
  fix was the premise of the full fix, as a redesign of luminance’s buffer interface was needed to fully fix the problem.
- Fix lifetime issue with slicing tessellation.
- Add support for `ShaderData` via `Std140` (`luminance-std140`).
- Implement the new `Uniformable` interface.
- Support for uniform array and runtime-check them.
- Support the new color clearing.
- Implement the new `TexelUpload` interface.

# 0.4

> Apr 25, 2021

- Support of `luminance-0.44` and its subsequent texture resizing and new texture creation interface.
- Use arrays instead of tuples for pixel encoding wherever it was applicable.
- Support for the Query API.
- Fix WebGL `impl` for arrays to be able to use them as source of initial storage for `Buffer`.
- Fix WebGL cubemap storage creation. The bug was making them completely unusable and highly distorted / corrupted.

# 0.3.2

> Oct 31st, 2020

- Fix a bug while getting the context’s initial value for the _depth write_ property (that one can change with
  `RenderState::set_depth_write`).

# 0.3.1

> Oct 31st, 2020

- Fix several uniform updates methods, that wouldn’t send data with the correct size, causing various random issues.

# 0.3

> Oct 28, 2020

## Patch

- Remove the limitation about creating contexts in WebGL: it is now possible to create as many as users want. WebGL
  doesn’t have the same requirements as OpenGL in terms of threading and contexts.

## Breaking changes

- Remove the `obtain_slice` and `obtain_slice_mut` methods. If you were using them, please feel free to use the `Deref`
  and `DerefMut` interface instead. It prevents one extra layer of useless validation via `Result`, since backends will
  simply always return `Ok(slice)`. The validation process is done when accessing the slice, e.g. `Buffer::slice` and
  `Buffer::slice_mut`.

# 0.2.1

> Oct 26th, 2020

- Add a bunch of `Debug` annotations.
- Add support for _scissor test_ implementation.

# 0.2

> Aug 30th, 2020

- Support of `luminance-0.42`.
- Add support for `UniformWarning::UnsupportedType`, which is raised when a uniform type is used by the client
  code while not supported by the backend implementation.

# 0.1.2

> Aug 18th, 2020

- Remove unnecessary type-erasure that was basically doing a no-op.
- Fix deinterleaved tessellation mapping that would map mutable slices with the wrong length.

# 0.1.1

> Jul 24th, 2020

- Support of `luminance-0.41`.

# 0.1

> Wed Jul, 15th 2020

- Initial revision.
