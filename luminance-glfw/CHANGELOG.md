# Changelog

This document is the changelog of [luminance-glfw](https://crates.io/crates/luminance-glfw).
You should consult it when upgrading to a new version, as it contains precious information on
breaking changes, minor additions and patch notes.

**If you’re experiencing weird type errors when upgrading to a new version**, it might be due to
how `cargo` resolves dependencies. `cargo update` is not enough, because all luminance crate use
[SemVer ranges](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html) to stay
compatible with as many crates as possible. In that case, you want `cargo update --aggressive`.

# 0.17

> Nov 26, 2021

- Add support for `glfw-0.42`.
- Remove support for `luminance-windowing`. The interface now requires you to pass a function to build the `Window` and
  the `Receiver` for the events. This might seem like a regression but it actually allows for a more flexible way to use
  `luminance`. Instead of hiding the window construction to the user and trying to do things for them, `luminance-glfw`
  now just passes the strict minimum to the `Glfw` object (basically, the OpenGL context), and the user can create the
  window the way they want.

# 0.16

> Jun 29, 2021

- Support of `luminance-0.44`.
- Lose support for `CursorMode`, which is now deprecated. If you were using it, you already have access to the
  underlying `glfw` objects in the `GlfwSurface`, so you can tweak them as you see fit.

# 0.15

> Feb 15, 2021

## Breaking changes

- Change the meaning of `GlfwSurface`. It now contains two separate objects that you can dissociate and use
  independently:
  - The event receiver from glfw. Use this with the GLFW API to retrieve / poll events.
  - A `GL33Context`, containing the GLFW window and the required internal luminance state, allowing you to perform
    rendering operations.
  This was needed to fix annoyances while iterating over events and wanting to make luminance calls — _deferring_ was
  required. This is no longer an issue with this fix and you can now issue luminance calls while iterating over events,
  yay, clap your hands if’re reading this!

# 0.6

> Fri Aug, 23th 2019

## Major changes

- Move `swap_buffers` from `GraphicsContext` to `Surface` in [luminance-windowing].

## Minor changes

- The `WindowOpt` now has support for multisampling. See the `WindowOpt::set_num_samples` for
  further details.
- Migrate to Rust Edition 2018.
- Implement dynamic edition of windowing types properties. That allows to change data on-the-fly,
  such as the cursor mode.

## Patch & misc changes

- Add more CI testing.
- Massive documentation rewrite (among the use of `#![deny(missing_docs)]`. The situation is still
  not perfect and patch versions will be released to fix and update the documentation. Step by
  step.
- Massive dependencies update. Special thanks to @eijebong for his help!

- Implement `Display` and `Error` for `GLFWDeviceError`.

# 0.4

> Sunday, 1st of October, 2017

- Use `luminance-windowing` to benefit from the types and functions defined in there.

# 0.3.3

> Saturday, 30th of September, 2017

- Remove the `luminance` dependency as it’s not needed anymore.

# 0.3.2

- All events are now polled, thus all kinds of events are now inspectable.

# 0.3.1

- Support for `glfw-0.16`.

# 0.3

- Removed `open_window` and moved its code into `Device::new`.
- Enhanced the documentation.

- Removed `Device::width` and `Device::height` and replaced them with `Device::size`.

# 0.2

- Changed the way events are handled. It doesn’t create an events thread anymore but instead exposes
